-- MCP Server SPCS Deployment Script
-- Execute these commands in Snowflake Web UI

-- 1. Create stage for service specification (if not exists)
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS SOCCER_GRAPH_SERVICE_SPEC;

-- 2. Upload service.yaml to the stage
-- Note: You must upload service.yaml manually through Snowflake Web UI
-- Navigate to: Data → Databases → ONTOLOGY_DB → SOCCER_KG → Stages → SOCCER_GRAPH_SERVICE_SPEC
-- Click "Upload Files" and select service.yaml

-- 3. Create or replace the SPCS service
CREATE OR REPLACE SERVICE soccer_mcp_server
  IN COMPUTE POOL GRAPH_ANALYTICS_POOL
  FROM SPECIFICATION '@"ONTOLOGY_DB"."SOCCER_KG"."SOCCER_GRAPH_SERVICE_SPEC"/service.yaml';

-- 4. Grant usage permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SERVICE soccer_mcp_server TO PUBLIC;

-- 5. Verify service status (wait a few minutes for startup)
SHOW SERVICES;

-- 6. Check service containers
SHOW SERVICE CONTAINERS IN SERVICE soccer_mcp_server;

-- 7. View service logs (for troubleshooting)
SELECT SYSTEM\$GET_SERVICE_LOGS('soccer_mcp_server', 'mcp-server', 0);

-- 8. Get service URL (once service is running)
SELECT SYSTEM\$GET_SERVICE_URL('soccer_mcp_server', 'graph-api');
